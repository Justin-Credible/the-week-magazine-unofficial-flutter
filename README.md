Unofficial app for _The Week_ magazine
===

This is an unofficial app for _[The Week](https://theweek.com/)_ magazine.

The [official Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dennis.theweek.us&hl=en) stopped working as of Android 6.0 (marshmallow). It simply crashes on startup. I am not the only one to experience this, as can be seen in the Google Play store reviews.

The magazine website has since pulled all mention of an Android app from their website. This seems to indicate they are no longer supporting it.

Therefore, I have created this unofficial app so Android users can continue to read the magazine.

I am not affiliated with _The Week_ in any way.

# :warning: Flutter Port

I originally wrote [this app](https://github.com/Justin-Credible/the-week-magazine-unofficial) in TypeScript and Java with Ionic for the user interface. This is port of the app to Dart with [Flutter](https://flutter.io/) for the user interface which I did as a learning exercise. If you are looking for a feature complete app, then you should check out the [Ionic version](https://github.com/Justin-Credible/the-week-magazine-unofficial).
